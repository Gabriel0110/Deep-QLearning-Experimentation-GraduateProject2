# Deep-QLearning-Experimentation-GraduateProject2
This is the second project from my Reinforcement Learning graduate program.

The goal of this project was to test different parameters for a Deep Q-Network and identify the best parameters to build the best model.

The parameters that were tested were Epsilon Decay, Gamma, and Learning Rate.
